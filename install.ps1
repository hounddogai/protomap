# Installs the ProtoMap CLI on Windows from its GitHub releases, or from ProtoMap's copy of them on Google Cloud when
# GitHub does not answer, in PowerShell. The latest release:
#
#   irm https://protomap.ai/install.ps1 | iex
#
# Or a version, such as the one a ProtoMap server runs, which then stays: it turns the CLI's automatic updates off,
# and installing the latest release turns them on again:
#
#   & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://protomap.ai/install.ps1))) -Version 0.1.0
#
# The CLI installs to %LOCALAPPDATA%\protomap\bin, or to PROTOMAP_INSTALL_DIR, and the folder goes first on the user's
# PATH. A folder named bin also keeps each version in versions\<version> beside it and names the current one in
# bin\current, the layout that `protomap update` keeps current; another folder holds just the binary. Run as an
# administrator, the script installs the CLI for every user, in %ProgramFiles%\protomap\bin, first on the system's
# PATH, and that CLI never updates itself: running this script again as an administrator upgrades it. An
# administrator's install in a folder outside Program Files, as PROTOMAP_INSTALL_DIR may name, is installed as a user's is.
# Releases have builds for Windows on amd64 and arm64, named protomap-windows-<arch>.exe, and a SHA256SUMS file that
# each download must match before it replaces the installed CLI. Linux and macOS install with install.sh instead.
#
# PROTOMAP_RELEASES_URL replaces https://github.com/hounddogai/protomap/releases, and PROTOMAP_RELEASES_MIRROR_URL the
# copy, https://storage.googleapis.com/protomap-releases. Each serves the same paths, as a test's server does:
# <url>/latest/download/<file> and <url>/download/<version>/<file>.

# The installation runs in a script block of its own, so that iex leaves no variables or preferences behind in the
# session that runs it.
